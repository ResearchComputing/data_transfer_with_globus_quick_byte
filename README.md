# Data Transfer with Globus Quick Byte

While utilizing CU Research Computing (CURC) resources such as Alpine or Blanca, you may 
need to transfer data between CURC file systems and your personal computer. Although 
several methods exist to do this, Globus offers a user-friendly point-and-click interface 
and is one of the most robust methods available.

In this RC Quick Byte*, we will demo how to sign into Globus Connect, connect your 
machine to Globus using Globus Connect Personal, and perform a data transfer. Attendees 
are welcomed to follow along, but the instructor won't be able to troubleshoot issues 
during the presentation.

\* Whatâ€™s an RC Quick Byte?: An RC Quick Byte is a 20-30 minute sessions intended to 
provide essential information about a specific topic. You can expect to leave a 'Quick 
Byte' with the information you need to apply a tool, service, or concept.
